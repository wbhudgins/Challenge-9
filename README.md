## Description

- I was getting tired of hard coding all my seperate README's

- I decided an easier way to solve this problem would be to make a project for this!,

- It saves you time from hard coding all your README's by taking in your information off a series of prompts and inserting it all into a Professional README instantly!

- I learned that using npm inquirer will come in handy for many years to come!
